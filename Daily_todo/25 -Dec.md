## List of works I did today

1. Covered concepts of recusions types with programming practice and tests (From Bari videos 51 - 60)
- head recursion concept with while loop (which does not work)
- use static vs global variable in recusion and check the output
- tree recursion
- indirect recusion - explored a number series we can achieve using this type of recursion
- nested recursion, checked results with differnet input number
